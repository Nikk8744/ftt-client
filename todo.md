# Freelance Time Tracker


## Todos:
- add dark mode(in dashboard)
- also remove the unwanted code from pages and components.
- improve the extra code that we have written.
- add the priority field at task level and filters according to it. (would need to update the db)


- so a task assignee should be able to edit the checklist in that task but not delete the task.

<!-- ! task assignee functionality - crud checklist, follow, track time, (no delete, edit & assign). -->
