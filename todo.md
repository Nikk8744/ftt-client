# Freelance Time Tracker


## Todos:
- add dark mode(in dashboard)
- also remove the unwanted code from pages and components.
- improve the extra code that we have written.


- so a task assignee should be able to edit the checklist in that task but not delete the task.

<!-- ! task assignee functionality - crud checklist, follow, track time, (no delete, edit & assign). -->

- when creating a task right now i am able to put the due date less than the current date, so need to sovlve this.
- chekc the above for projects too.
